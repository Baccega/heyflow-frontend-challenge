# Heyflow Frontend Challenges

This is my solution for the following Heyflow Frontend Challenges:

- JSON Explorer
- Custom Checkbox

## How to run

I've used Node 20.9.0 to develop this project, so I recommend using the same version to avoid any issues (if there are any).

First, install the dependencies (I've used pnpm, but you can use npm if you prefer):

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Then build and run:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
